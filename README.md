# K DINESH CHITRA - Personal Portfolio 

[https://kdineshchitra.github.io/](https://kdineshchitra.github.io/)

This repository is for my portfolio site hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)  
I used the [Freelancer theme from the Start Bootstrap website](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer) as a template and modified the contents & some of the settings according to my needs. 

Note:
*I don't create or own any of the brand logos displayed on this site. All the logos are downloaded from the internet. All credits go to the respective creators.*

On the portfolio site, you can find my other social links and an overview of all of my projects, even you can see my awkwardly smiling photo there.
More importantly, you can read and know what I am up to in the *ABOUT ME* section of the site.  

Kindly visit [the site](https://kdineshchitra.github.io/) and [my works](https://github.com/kdineshchitra?tab=repositories), and share your thoughts and suggestions with me.  

**Keep learning, keep thriving.**
